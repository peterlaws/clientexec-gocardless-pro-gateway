Clientexec GoCardless Gateway Plugin for the Pro Basic API
==========================================================

**Version Update: I am updating the plugin for international payments and based businesses, please check back regulary** 

You can now provide Direct Debit as a payment option for your business using the Clientexec GoCardless Gateway Plugin. Simple, digital, powerful. Scroll down for more details of its features.

This version is ten times better than the old version, you and your clients can do everything inside of Clientexec, from creating mandates to retrying and cancelling payments.

There are three price schemes, an owned version where you can pay once and you own the license, and the other two are a monthly leased license payment where you get unlimited updates and 16 hours (9am to 12am UK time) a day ticket and
