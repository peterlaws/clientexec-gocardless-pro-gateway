Language Files
==============

The plugin will take note of Clientexec's client and system default settings . I am looking for people who can maintain language files, if you can help, please download the language.en.php file.

Languages curently active: **British English**

The languages I am looking to translate to is: **Dutch, Farsi, French, Portuguese and Spanish**.  
These are the current languages Clientexec supports, it may add new languages in future, and I would need help to translate these a well.


If you wish to translate this to another language, copy and rename this file language.<language code>.php eg. for Spanish, language.es.php.

Then edit the lines after the =>, do not edit the first lines before the =>

Whenever there's special characters for languages, you must save the file with UNICODE UTF-8
